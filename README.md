### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Max. 

Currently, I'm a Master's student learning everything I can about Data Science through Columbia's Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) program. It's an interdisciplinary degree that focuses on applying statistics fundamentals and proper research methodology to a variety of topics. Read more about my program here: https://qmss.columbia.edu/

At the moment, primary research interest is large language models. However, through my recent studies, I've also gained an interest in broader tech-oriented ways to apply data science principles. 

ðŸ’¬ For now, I'm honing some advanced machine learning techniques, learning more about natural language processing, and practicing other various quantitative skills. I hope to use this platform to soon host some of my favorite or perhaps most meaningful work.

âš¡ A bit about me -- I love to be active! I love running (xc and track in college), skateboarding, biking, and skiing. I used to compete in tournaments for some video games, I love all sorts of music, and I'm a huge movie nerd.

If you think I might benefit from your knowledge somehow, please contact me!

p.s. I'm starting to write a bit on medium. Check out my profile: https://medium.com/@ms6539
