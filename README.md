### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Max. 

Currently, I'm a Master's student learning everything I can about Data Science through Columbia's Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) program. It's an interdisciplinary degree that focuses on applying statistics fundamentals and proper research methodology to a variety of topics. Read more about my program here: https://qmss.columbia.edu/

My primary research interest is in environmental sustainibility ðŸŒ±, so I'm starting to see some really cool ways data science can be applied to the field. However, through my recent studies, I've gained an interest in other, tech-oriented ways to apply data science principles. 

ðŸ’¬ For now, I'm honing some advanced regression techniques, learning more about machine learning, and practicing other various quantitative skills. I hope to use this platform to host some of my favorite or perhaps most meaningful work.

If you think I might benefit from your knowledge somehow, please contact me!
