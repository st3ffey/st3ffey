### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Max. 

Currently, I'm a Master's student learning everything I can about Data Science through Columbia's Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences (QMSS) program. Read more about my program here: https://qmss.columbia.edu/

At the moment, primary research interest is large language models. However, I love all things machine learning and I love (trying) to stay up to date with all of the cool stuff happening daily in the GenAI field.



âš¡ A bit about me -- I love to be active! I love running (xc and track in college), skateboarding, biking, and skiing. I used to compete in tournaments for some video games, I love all sorts of music, and I'm a huge movie nerd.

p.s. I'm starting to write a bit on medium. Check out my profile: https://medium.com/@ms6539
