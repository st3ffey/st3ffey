### Hi there 👋 I'm Max. This is my personal, recreational account, where I host some practice and side-projects. 

I'm a recently graduated Master's student learning everything I can about Data Science and Machine Learning.

At the moment, I'm particularly interested in applications of large language models. I was an early proponent of retrieval augmented generation, and have been practicing this sytem for a while. Still, I love all things machine learning and I love (trying) to stay up to date with all of the cool stuff happening daily in the GenAI field.

⚡ A bit about me -- I love to be active! I love running (xc and track in college), skateboarding, biking, outdoorsy stuff, and skiing. I used to compete in tournaments for some video games, I love all sorts of music (especially electronic! DJing on the side.), and I'm a huge movie nerd.

p.s. I'm dabbling on medium. Check out my profile: https://medium.com/@ms6539
